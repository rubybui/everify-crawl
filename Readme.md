# E-Verify Crawler

This project is a Python-based web crawler designed to scrape company data from the [E-Verify website](https://www.e-verify.gov/). The script uses `requests` to fetch data, `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing, and `pandas` to save the scraped data to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extracts data such as company name, industry type, workforce size, hiring sites, and location by state from the E-Verify website.
- **Incremental Saving**: Saves data to `company_data.csv` every 50 pages to manage memory usage efficiently.
- **Pagination Control**: Skips already processed pages and resumes from a specified target page.
- **Error Handling**: Implements retry logic for network issues, rate-limiting, and connection errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- The following libraries are required (stored in `requirements.txt`):
  - `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the E-Verify website.
  - `pandas`: For organizing data and saving it to a CSV file.
  - `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the crawler, execute the main script:

```bash
python everify.py
```

### Parameters

- **`target_start_page`**: Set this variable in the script to the page number where you want the crawler to start.
- **`output_csv`**: The name of the output CSV file where data will be saved. Default is `company_data.csv`.

### Sample Data

The script extracts and saves the following data for each company:

- **Primary Industry Type**
- **Employer Name**
- **Doing Business As (DBA)**
- **Workforce Size**
- **Number of Hiring Sites**
- **Hiring Site Locations by State**

## Error Handling

- **Rate Limiting**: If the server returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) or 403 (Forbidden), the crawler waits for 5 minutes before retrying.
- **Connection Issues**: If a connection error occurs, the script will retry up to 3 times with a 5-minute delay between attempts.
- **Page Skipping**: If resuming from a specified target page, the script calculates and skips pages to reach the desired start point.

## Potential Updates

This crawler may be subject to disruptions due to rate limiting or structural changes in the website. To address this, we plan to add the following features:

- **Mid-Scrape Restarting**: The ability to specify a starting page or state directly from the command line to facilitate resuming after interruptions.
- **State-Based Scraping**: A parameter to specify which state(s) to scrape, allowing for partial or targeted data collection.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Enhanced handling for cases where the website structure or pagination changes, ensuring more robust data collection.

### Explanation of the Updates Section

- **Mid-Scrape Restarting**: Describes the planned feature to start scraping from a specific page or state, which is especially useful if the process is interrupted.
- **State-Based Scraping**: Allows users to scrape data selectively by state, useful for targeted data collection.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Mentions plans to improve the robustness of error handling in case of structural changes on the website.

These updates will give users a clear understanding of potential future improvements and address known limitations. Adjust the wording as needed to fit your specific project scope.
